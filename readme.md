# My First Readme

I'm going to use this readme to document what we've learned about Github!

- Creating the Repo
    1. create an empty folder `mkdir folder`
    2. cd into that folder `cd folder`
    3. initialized the repo `git init`

- Commit your work periodically
    1. add files to staging `git add .`
    2. commit files `git commit -m "commit message`

- Push work to Github
    1. create a new repo in github
    2. copy the url (ssh or https)
    3. add the remote repo to local repo `git remote add origin`
    4. push the commit from local to remote `git push origin main`

- misc commands
    1. see the status of repo `git status`
    2. see the branch your are on `git branch`
    3. see previous commits `git log`
    4. see remote list `git remote -v`
    5. remove current origin remote `git remote rm origin`
